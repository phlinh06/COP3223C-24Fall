A) For a better learning experience, it is suggested that you work with 1 or 2 classmates on this HW (or any HW and project). In case you work in group, each group member must:

  1) Include the names of all groupmates as a comment in the .c file

  2) Submit the .c file (No submission = score of 0. No exception!). Submission is done via Webcourses ONLY.

3) Students who work in group and don't submit the .c file will receive the score of 0. Save your time by emailing the instructor/TAs saying that "I can prove that I worked on the HW with abc and xyz!"

B) Once again, Working in groups is an excellent learning opportunity, but that might not go well. The instructor and the TAs will not look into any group issues when grading your work. Consequently, if you feel that your group members aren't doing what is supposed from them to be done, then quit that group and finish the work yourself and submit. The trick here is to start early!

C) HW is due on 11/24 11:59 pm, and late submission is due on 11/26. Any HW submitted within 11/25 12:00 am - 11/26 11:59 pm will be penalized by a deduction of 30%. No submission will be possible after 11/26 11:59 pm
